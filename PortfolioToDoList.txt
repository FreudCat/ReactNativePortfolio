 - p/e ratio calculations
 - what values do we need 
   - what can b


Can get: 
   current stock price 
   earnings per share 
      PE: current stock price / EPS 


BETA 
beta = covariance/variance
covariance: measure of stocks return relative to that of the market
    measures how to stocks move together 
    positive means they move together 
variance: measure of how a stock moves relative to its mean 
    used in measuring volatility of individual stock prices 
    over time. variance measures how one stock moves against 
    itself, covariance measure how two stocks move against each 
    other. 
usually use benchmarks like S and P and dow jones as the covariance
against an individual stock.

will probably need to use excel formulas to calculate beta 

Also look at PEG (price to earnings to growth) ratio 
PEG less than 1 is undervalued (may be useful in comparing to PE? 


calculating EPS 
   annual AND quarterly - can we graph it? 
   The quarterly EPS figures can be important when:

The company is growing rapidly.
The company is restoring profitability after several unprofitable periods. In other words, when the company is having a successful turnaround.
The company is in decline. It is losing sales, market share, and profits.
